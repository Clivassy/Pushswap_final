## About The Project

This is a progect that involves two stacks named 'a' and 'b'. 
The 'a' stack initially contains a random quantity of negative and/or positive numbers that cannot be duplicated, 
while the 'b' stack is empty. The objective of the project is to sort the numbers in stack 'a' in ascending order. 
The project includes various instructions to manipulate the stacks, such as swapping the top two elements, 
pushing the top element from one stack to the other, rotating the stack by moving the first element to the last, 
and reverse rotating the stack by moving the last element to the first. 
The program ends when the stack 'a' is sorted in ascending order.
